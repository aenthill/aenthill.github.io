A colony is an ecosystem of *Aents* which are able to work together.

* [TheAentMachine](https://google.fr) is a colony for adding services on the fly in a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and Kubernetes configuration file
* Add your own colony by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/aenthill/aenthill.github.io/pulls)!
